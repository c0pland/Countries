The Schengen Agreement aims to promote the free movement of people, goods, and services among its member states, while also enhancing security by ensuring that the external borders of the area are properly controlled. This is achieved through a combination of common rules on external border controls and visa policies, as well as cooperation among member states in areas such as law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Citizens of member states can travel within the Schengen Area without the need for border controls or visas. Non-EU nationals can also travel within the area if they hold a valid Schengen visa. The Schengen Area is therefore a key facilitator of tourism, trade, and cross-border cooperation in Europe.",

Once a country joins the Eurozone, it is subject to the same monetary policy as the other members, and it no longer has the ability to independently devalue its currency to address economic problems. The Eurozone has had a significant impact on the economic landscape of Europe, promoting trade and investment among its member states and contributing to the growth of the EU economy as a whole. However, it has also faced a number of challenges, including the Eurozone debt crisis, which highlighted the need for greater fiscal integration among its member states.",

It also includes provisions for military cooperation and intelligence sharing among its members. While the ANZUS treaty remains in force, its practical application has varied over time. In 1985, the United States suspended its treaty obligations to New Zealand after the New Zealand government declared a nuclear-free zone, which included a ban on visits by nuclear-armed or powered warships. Despite this, the ANZUS alliance remains an important symbol of cooperation and shared security interests between its members.
